								There is a fascinating myth about Thrikkakara connecting Vamana, the fifth avatar of Lord Vishnu (also called Thrikkakarayappan) and asura (demon) King Mahabali, popular among his subjects as poverty and sorrow were unheard of during his reign. 
								This popularity made the gods jealous and they tricked Mahabali into being banished to Patala, the nether world. He was given permission to visit his subjects once a year. Onam, the famous harvest festival of Kerala is a celebration of this yearly visit. </p>
                        <p> The Administrative office coordinates all the activities of the departments and affiliated colleges. The fully computerised Central Library is a central source of information for the academic community of the CUSAT. The Computer Center provides free internet access to the students. The campus hosts the buildings of the departments.
