                        <p>Established in <b>1971</b> and named as <b> University of Cochin</b>, it was the symbol of commitment from the Government of Kerala towards the 
                        new scientific policy resolution adopted by the Central Government on <b>4th March 1958</b>. 
                        The birth of the new University was with the specific purpose of “development of higher education with particular emphasis 
                        on post-graduate studies and research in applied science, technology, 
                        industry and commerce”. The University of Cochin was later reorganized as<b> Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT)</b> in <b>February 1986</b>. Specialisations are available in  all Faculties/Departments for higher studies and research. By giving recognition to several well-established premier research institutions in the country and the Southern Naval Command of Indian Navy, the University has brought within its reach the resources available in these institutions also to the use of our  academic community. </p>

<h3>Vision </h3>
<p>The University’s basic philosophy and goals find eloquent expression in its Coat of Arms emblazoning the motto “Tejaswinavadhitamastu” which in essence means “may the wisdom accrued defy us both the teacher and the taught and percolate to the Universe in its totality”, which in essence means “may learning illumine us both” (the teacher and the taught).</p>
